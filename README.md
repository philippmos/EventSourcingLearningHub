# EventSourcingLearningHub
## About the Project

EventSourcingLearningHub is a learning project designed to explore the implementation of distributed systems using the event sourcing pattern. The goal is to demonstrate the advantages of this architectural style by leveraging multiple technologies, including:

- **.NET**
- **Python**
- **Go**
- **TypeScript**


## Why Event Sourcing?

Event sourcing is a powerful pattern that provides:

- **Auditability**: Every change to the system is recorded as an immutable event.
- **Scalability**: Enables distributed systems to scale efficiently.
- **Flexibility**: Replay events to rebuild system state or debug issues.
- **Technology Agnosticism**: Works seamlessly across different programming languages and platforms.


## Personal Goals

This project is a personal learning journey:

- **Mastering Event Sourcing**: Deepening my understanding of the event sourcing pattern and its practical applications.
- **Exploring Technologies**: Gaining hands-on experience with various programming languages and frameworks.
- **Building Expertise**: Developing a solid foundation in distributed systems and architectural design.
- **Experimentation**: Trying out new ideas and approaches to solve complex problems.
